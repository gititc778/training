✅ What You Should Do:
Create a New Storage Account with HNS Enabled:

Go to Azure Portal → Storage Accounts → Create.

Under Advanced → Data Lake Storage Gen2, check:

✅ Enable hierarchical namespace

This new account will support Synapse Analytics features that rely on HNS (like workspace default storage, or certain query types).

Move or Copy Your Data (if needed):

Use AzCopy, Azure Data Factory, or Storage Explorer to migrate existing data from your non-HNS account to the new one.
